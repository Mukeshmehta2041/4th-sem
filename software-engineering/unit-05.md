## 1. Software Maintenance
- **Need**: Software must evolve to fix defects, adapt to changes, and improve performance
- **Types of Maintenance**:
  - **Corrective**: Fixing errors/bugs
  - **Adaptive**: Modifying for new environments
  - **Perfective**: Enhancing features/performance
  - **Preventive**: Preventing future problems

## 2. Software Configuration Management (SCM)
- **Definition**: Managing changes to software artifacts
- **Activities**:
  - Version control
  - Change control
  - Status accounting
  - Auditing
- **Benefits**: Traceability, reproducibility, control

## 3. Software Change Management
- **Process**: Request → Impact Analysis → Approval → Implementation → Verification
- **Change Control Board (CCB)**: Group that reviews and approves changes
- **Reporting**: Documenting changes, status, and impact

## 4. Version Control
- **Purpose**: Track and manage changes to code and documents
- **Types**:
  - Centralized (e.g., SVN)
  - Distributed (e.g., Git)
- **Features**: Branching, merging, history, rollback

## 5. Change Control and Reporting
- **Change Control**: Procedures for managing changes
- **Reporting**: Communicating status, progress, and issues

## 6. Program Comprehension Techniques
- **Goal**: Understand existing codebase
- **Techniques**:
  - Code reading
  - Documentation
  - Visualization tools
  - Reverse engineering

## 7. Re-engineering and Reverse Engineering
- **Re-engineering**: Modifying software to improve it without changing functionality
- **Reverse Engineering**: Analyzing software to extract design and requirements
- **Tool Support**: Automated tools for code analysis, refactoring, documentation

## 8. Project Management Concepts
- **Project Management**: Planning, organizing, and controlling resources to achieve goals
- **Key Areas**:
  - Scope
  - Time
  - Cost
  - Quality
  - Risk
  - Communication

## 9. Feasibility Analysis
- **Purpose**: Assess if project is viable
- **Types**:
  - Technical
  - Economic
  - Legal
  - Operational
  - Schedule

## 10. Project and Process Planning
- **Project Planning**: Define objectives, scope, deliverables, schedule
- **Process Planning**: Select and tailor development processes

## 11. Resource Allocation
- **Resources**: People, tools, infrastructure
- **Allocation**: Assigning resources to tasks for optimal use

## 12. Software Efforts, Schedule, and Cost Estimations
- **Effort Estimation**: Predicting work required (person-months)
- **Schedule Estimation**: Timeline for tasks
- **Cost Estimation**: Budgeting for resources, tools, etc.
- **Techniques**:
  - Expert judgment
  - Analogy-based
  - Algorithmic (e.g., COCOMO)

## 13. Project Scheduling and Tracking
- **Scheduling**: Creating timelines (Gantt charts, PERT charts)
- **Tracking**: Monitoring progress, milestones, deliverables

## 14. Risk Assessment and Mitigation
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying and analyzing risks
- **Mitigation**: Planning actions to reduce impact
- **Examples**: Technical risks, schedule risks, cost risks

## 15. Software Quality Assurance (SQA)
- **Definition**: Ensuring software meets quality standards
- **Activities**:
  - Reviews
  - Audits
  - Testing
  - Standards compliance

## 16. Project Plan
- **Contents**:
  - Objectives
  - Scope
  - Schedule
  - Resources
  - Risk management
  - Quality plan

## 17. Project Metrics
- **Purpose**: Measure project performance and quality
- **Examples**:
  - Effort variance
  - Schedule variance
  - Defect density
  - Productivity (LOC/person-month)
  - Cost performance index
